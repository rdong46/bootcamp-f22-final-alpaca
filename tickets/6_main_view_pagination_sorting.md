## Main View - Implement Sorting and Pagination

Context: We'd like our screen to be relevant and easy to read for the user without overwhelming them.

Blockers:

- This ticket cannot be completed until the Main View ticket has been completed

What you need to implement:

- Sorting - newest posts should show up at the top of the page
  - Revisit your existing API endpoint that fetches all posts and modify it so that the posts are ordered by most recent to least recent
- Pagination - only show 10 posts at a time

Acceptance Criteria:

- Pagination should be done client-side, similar to what you did for Mini-Project 2
