## Main View - Read from DB and display

Context: We need a home screen where the user can view their feed of posts.

What you need to implement:

- View posts
  - Note: this can be infinitely scrolling and in any order. There is another ticket that will handle the organization of the posts later
- The number of comments should be shown, along with the date it was written
- Each post should be clickable and link to its specific URL page
- API endpoint for getting all posts

Acceptance Criteria:
